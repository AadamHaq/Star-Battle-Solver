# Star-Battle-Solver

The aim of the project is to create an autosolver for the starbattle game. This will be done in two stages:

- LinkedIn Queens Solver
- Star Battle solver (2 and 3 stars)

Star Battle is a generalisation of the LinkedIn Queens game. An example can be found [here](https://www.puzzle-star-battle.com/)

## LinkedIn Queens Solver

To solve LinkedIn Queens, I want to use several techniques:
- Backtracking (Naive solution as a baseline)
- Linear Programming
  - This will constitute breaking the game into its pure logic and creating linear equations
- Reinforcement Learning Approach
  - Will train daily and then test using saved weights

Additionally, I am to scrape the current day's puzzle and solve it, before then seeing if it can be inputted to beat some of my friend's times!
